			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I am a passionate web developer who is driven by my curiosity and continually seeks to grow as a programmer. I love solving problems not only individually, but also in a team setting where I can collaborate with other talented programmers. I am someone who enjoys working with different personalities, and I believe that working with others grows us as programmers and people. Therefore, I am open to providing any type of service for my clients. The following is a list of programming languages that I can work with:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Javascript</li>
				<li>HTML5</li>
				<li>CSS</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Outside of programming, I am still a very curious person. I love learning about things that interest me. I care about people and want to be someone who can make a difference in many lives no matter how small it may be. My hobbies include sports as well as exploring the art of coffee!
